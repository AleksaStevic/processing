# My processing projects
This repository includes various projects and sketches made with Processing IDE. The projects are inspired by [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/), the former project lead with [Processing Foundation](https://processing.org/). I am still building up this repository but my idea is to improve Shiffman's ideas in more creative way. You can find all his projects on his [Github](https://github.com/shiffman).

If you want to create your own projects from these ideas and if you want to learn more about Processing, you can watch the series of tutorials at [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) youtube channel hosted by Daniel.
