# Face Evolution
This [Processing](https://processing.org/) sketch is interactive linear regression simulation. The point is created at mouse position in the window every time the mouse is clicked. If there are 2 or more points, the linear regression line is automatically calculated using formula.
This is inspired by [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman)'s projects.

Information about compiling and running this sketch are explained in my [processing](https://github.com/AleksaStevic/processing/) repository at [Github](https://github.com/).
