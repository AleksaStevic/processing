# Face Evolution
This [Processing](https://processing.org/) sketch is using simple genetic algorithm to modify and evolve a list of faces (smileys).
This is inspired by [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman)'s projects.

Information about compiling and running this sketch are explained in my [processing](https://github.com/AleksaStevic/processing/) repository at [Github](https://github.com/).
