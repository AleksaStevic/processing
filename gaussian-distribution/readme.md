# Gaussian distribution
This is the animation of gaussian distribution of random numbers.

Every frame of the animation random number is generated. The number is random, but not completely.

In gaussian distribution there is mean and deviation. Random generated number is more likely to be near the mean of the gaussian distribution. For example: Every human appears to have random height, but most humans have the height near the average (mean) height. Very small number of humans is very tall and very small number of humans is very short.
